    <p>Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied".[32] His work on the subject, usually referred to 
        as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.[33] His work De analysi per 
        aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins
         that August as the work "of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things".[34]</p>

        Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the Leibnizâ€“Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more 
        convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.[citation needed]</p>
